Band Bio

The story of Maroon 5 begins with a prologue. In 1994, while still in high school, Adam Levine, Jesse Carmichael, Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick (left the band in 2006) formed the band Kara's Flowers. They were signed to Reprise Records and released an album, The Fourth World, in 1997. The response wasn't great, and the band split up while the musicians attended various colleges.

In 2001 the friends got back together, along with guitaris James Valentine, and Maroon 5 was born. Their first album, Songs about Jane, debuted at number 5 on the Billboard 200 chart. By 2004 the album went platinum and the band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005. In 2006, drummer Ryan Dusick left the band after wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced with Matt Flynn. 

The band released 3 albums over the next 6 years with several very successful songs and three songs ("Makes Me Wonder"-It Won't Be Soon Before Long; "Moves Like Jagger"-2011 Single; and "One More Night"-Overexposed) made it to the #1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100. The band added it's sixth member, keyboardist PJ Morton in 2012. That same year the band took on Sam Farrar as a touring member when Jesse Carmichael began a two year hiatus, Carmichael returning in time to record their fifth studio album, title "V".
